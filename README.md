This project is to automate the creation of a dataset containing all companies that are producing an average of at least 10 barrels of oil or gas that are within a quarter mile of a water well.
It creates the full dataset in addition to a summary dataset containing the important information reguarding each companies production for a given year. 

The public data sets are in the repo. 

Inside the dist directory there is an executable to allow easy use of the program. The created files will be placed in the same directory that the executable runs in.
