This project is to automate the creation of a dataset containing all companies that are producing an average of at least 10 barrels of oil or gas that are within a quarter mile of a water well.
It creates the full dataset in addition to a summary dataset containing the important information reguarding each companies production for a given year. 
The public data sets are in the repo.
